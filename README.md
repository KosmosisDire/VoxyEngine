# Voxy Engine

Voxy Engine is a raymarched mini voxel engine / game project. 

Please note that this is a hobby project and the code is probably messy, unorganized, and unoptimized.
<br>
However, feel free to give advice or submit a PR if you would like :)

## Features
- A dynamic, falling sand simulated world
- Transparent and textured materials
- Smooth per voxel normals
- Raytraced ambient occlusion
- World editing at different block scales
- Terrain generation
- Player controller with world collisions
- Simple OpenGL engine to handle shaders, meshes, cameras, windowing, and math.

## Building

The project can be built by simply installing the .NET SDK: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet
The project is currently using .NET 8.0, however I will probably switch to .NET 9.0 soon.

Right now I am handling paths to the shader files by setting the working directory to the root of my project inside C#. This is obviously not a great way to do it, but for testing I haven't made a better solution.
So in order to run it, update this line in `Program.cs`
```csharp
Environment.CurrentDirectory = @"C:\Main\Projects\Coding\C#\VoxyEngine\src";
```

Then open the project and run `dotnet run` in the terminal, or use VSCode to debug the project.
